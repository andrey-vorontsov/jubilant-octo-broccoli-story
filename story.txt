This is Andrey's story file.

A lonely starship drifts alone through the coldness of space. The stainless steel hull reflects the light of alien stars, many millions of miles from home. Ron leans back in his captain's chair, his eyes focused on one of the many glowing displays in the cockpit. He smiles, because his destination is near. "Computer!" he says. "Prepare for landing."

"Yes, Master." Computer replies, "The starship will land in 5 minutes. Your destination is The Earth. Good luck with your vocation!" Five mintues later, the starship lands on the Earth and Alien Space Station. Ron leaves his starship with Computer inside his wristwatch, and he takes a air-car to the embassy.

"I am the Captin of the startship Voyager from the Permanent Galaxy. I was given a mission to detect earth's atmosphere and minerals. This is my Identification. " He talks to the staff of embassy. "Sure Sir, Let to comfirm your information quickly." Staff replies.Soon, a bracelet was handed over. "This is a temporary bracelet for vistors. You can save your personal info into it and utalize it with your daily life. Have a good trip in Earth!" 

Ron walks around in awe of this beautiful planet. He sees trees, lakes, parks and people having fun. He sees couples dancing, kids playing outside and families eating at a restaurant. What a different world this was compared to what he knew at his own home planet. Suddenly, Ron wondered whether he wanted to go back home. He did not care about collecting atmospheric and mineral samples anymore. He examined the bracelet on his wrist and finally, slowly slipped it off.
