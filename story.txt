This is Andrey's story file.

A lonely starship drifts alone through the coldness of space. The stainless steel hull reflects the light of alien stars, many millions of miles from home. Ron leans back in his captain's chair, his eyes focused on one of the many glowing displays in the cockpit. He smiles, because his destination is near. "Computer!" he says. "Prepare for landing."

"Yes, Master." Computer replies, "The starship will land in 5 minutes. Your destination is The Earth. Good luck with your vocation!" Five mintues later, the starship lands on the Earth and Alien Space Station. Ron leaves his starship with Computer inside his wristwatch, and he takes a air-car to the embassy.
